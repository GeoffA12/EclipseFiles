3. in the test, StackTest.java
put a breakpoint at line: 50
debug to that break point
a) what is the max size of s1? 3

b) what is the max size of s2? 2

c) what is the max size of s3? 4

4. put a breakpoint at line 77.
step over method call to toString().
a) what is the value of str [t, h, i, r, d, 
, s, e, c, o, n, d, 
, f, i, r, s, t, 
]

5. put a breakpoint at line 120.
a) what is the current contents of s2? 2

6. put a breakpoint at line 188
